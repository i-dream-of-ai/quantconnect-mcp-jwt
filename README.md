# QuantConnect MCP Server
The QuantConnect MCP Server is a bridge for AIs (such as Claude and OpenAI o3 Pro) to interact with our cloud platform. When equipped with our MCP, the AI can perform tasks on your behalf through our API such as updating projects, writing strategies, backtesting, and deploying strategies to production live-trading.

Our implementation is tested and dockerized for easy cross-platform deployment.

## Getting Started
To connect local MCP clients (like Claude Desktop) to the QC MCP Server, follow these steps:

1. Install and open [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).
2. Install and open [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download).
3. In Claude Desktop, click **File > Settings > Developer > Edit Config**.
4. Edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to include the following `quantconnect` configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantconnect": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "QUANTCONNECT_USER_ID",
        "-e", "QUANTCONNECT_API_TOKEN",
        "-e", "AGENT_NAME",
        "--platform", "<your_platform>",
        "--name",
        "quantconnect-mcp-server",
        "quantconnect/mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "QUANTCONNECT_USER_ID": "<your_user_id>",
        "QUANTCONNECT_API_TOKEN": "<your_api_token>",
        "AGENT_NAME": "MCP Server"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  To get your user Id and API token, see [Request API Token](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/community/profile#09-Request-API-Token).

  Our MCP server is multi-platform capable. The options are `linux/amd64` for Intel/AMD chips and `linux/arm64` for ARM chips (for example, Apple's M-series chips).

  If you simultaneously run multiple agents, set a unique value for the `AGENT_NAME` environment variable for each agent to keep record of the request source. 

5. Restart Claude Desktop.

   Claude Desktop automatically pulls our MCP server from Docker Hub and connects to it.

To view all the MCP clients and the features they support, see the [Feature Support Matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients#feature-support-matrix) in the MCP documentation.

To keep the Docker image up-to-date, pull the latest MCP server from Docker Hub in the terminal.
```
docker pull quantconnect/mcp-server
```
If you have an ARM chip, add the `--platform linux/arm64` option.
